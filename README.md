# Payload-and-Polyglot-Lists
This is a list of payloads that are constantly under maintenance. <- It hasn't been in a long time. I'll revisit/ fix it eventually.

*Note - I did not create all of these payloads, rather I scour the internet looking for interesting polyglots and payloads. A lot of the credit goes to ismailtsdln, six2dez, hacktricks, payloadallthethings, and albinowax. If anything interests you feel free to reach out to me.*

Feel free to fork as well!
